/**
 * Use the `akamai.getAppSecRuleUpgradeDetails` data source to retrieve information on changes to the KRS rule sets.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const configuration = akamai.getAppSecConfiguration({
 *     name: _var.security_configuration,
 * });
 * const upgradeDetails = Promise.all([configuration, configuration]).then(([configuration, configuration1]) => akamai.getAppSecRuleUpgradeDetails({
 *     configId: configuration.configId,
 *     version: configuration1.latestVersion,
 *     securityPolicyId: _var.security_policy_id,
 * }));
 * export const upgradeDetailsText = upgradeDetails.then(upgradeDetails => upgradeDetails.outputText);
 * export const upgradeDetailsJson = upgradeDetails.then(upgradeDetails => upgradeDetails.json);
 * ```
