/**
 * Use the `akamai.AppSecByPassNetworkList` data source to retrieve information about which network
 * lists are used in the bypass network lists settings.  The information available is described
 * [here](https://developer.akamai.com/api/cloud_security/application_security/v1.html#getbypassnetworklistsforawapconfigversion).
 * Note: this data source is only applicable to WAP (Web Application Protector) configurations.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const configuration = akamai.getAppSecConfiguration({
 *     name: _var.security_configuration,
 * });
 * const bypassNetworkLists = configuration.then(configuration => akamai.getAppSecBypassNetworkLists({
 *     configId: configuration.configId,
 * }));
 * export const bypassNetworkListsOutput = bypassNetworkLists.then(bypassNetworkLists => bypassNetworkLists.outputText);
 * export const bypassNetworkListsJson = bypassNetworkLists.then(bypassNetworkLists => bypassNetworkLists.json);
 * export const bypassNetworkListsIdList = bypassNetworkLists.then(bypassNetworkLists => bypassNetworkLists.bypassNetworkLists);
 * ```
